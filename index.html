          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            Trask was born in Manvel, Texas, where he played high school
            football. He notoriously did not start any games after his freshman
            year before attending the University of Florida. After struggling
            with injuries during his first couple of years at UF, Trask took
            over as the starting quarterback during the 2019 season when Feleipe
            Franks was injured. Since then, he has had unparallelled success and
            has gone on to become the leading candidate for the Heisman trophy
            for the 2020 CFB season.
